# Allegro_Invoice_Generator

## AIG - Allegro Invoice Generator - is dedicated for Allegro sellers who need to create invoices for their customers. 
## This app generates invoices via .csv file provided by Allegro site. Is adapted for polish users. 

Demonstration of how it works is shown on a sample .csv file generated by Allegro in which sensitive data has been changed. 
**NOTE**: Total cost and sum of each sets might not sum together if you enter wrong price. Total cost ('Razem do zap≈Çaty') is read directly from .csv file whereas price for individual set sadly cannot be extracted from this .csv file so is need to be entered manually. 
Likewise for unit price ('cena / sztuka') compared to total price of sets ('cena razem'). The first one is need to be entered manually, the second one is read from the file.

It is constantly used by its creator :)
